There is no single Uniswap function to calculate the final applied slippage for a completed transaction, because slippage is determined by market conditions at the time of execution, not by the protocol itself. However, you can calculate the actual slippage after the transaction using a simple formula. It is important to distinguish between two concepts: Slippage tolerance: The setting you define before a swap to set the maximum price movement you are willing to accept.Applied slippage: The actual difference between the price you expected and the final price your trade was executed at. How to calculate slippage after a transaction You can determine the exact slippage percentage using data from your executed trade. \(Slippage\ (\) Here is an example: Expected Price: Before your swap, Uniswap's interface quoted you a rate of 1 ETH = 2,000 USDC.Executed Price: You check your transaction details on a block explorer and find your trade executed at a rate of 1 ETH = 2,000.4 USDC.Calculation:\(Slippage\ (\%)=\frac{(2000.4-2000)}{2000}\times 100\)\(Slippage\ (\%)=\frac{0.4}{2000}\times 100\)\(Slippage\ (\%)=0.02\%\) How to calculate price impact before a swap What you can calculate beforehand is price impact, which is the effect your trade will have on the pool's price, separate from broader market fluctuations. The calculation is based on the Uniswap V2 constant product formula (\(x\times y=k\)). Find the pool's current reserves for both tokens (e.g., 2,000,000 USDC and 1,000 ETH).Calculate the constant product (\(k\)) by multiplying the current reserves (\(2,000,000\times 1,000=2,000,000,000\)).Add your trade amount to the reserve of the token you are swapping (e.g., swapping 10,000 USDC, so the new reserve is 2,010,000 USDC).Calculate the new reserve of the other token by dividing the constant product by the new reserve from the previous step (\(2,000,000,000/2,010,000=995.02\) ETH).Determine the amount received by subtracting the new reserve from the original (\(1,000-995.02=4.98\) ETH).Calculate the price impact by comparing the executed price (your trade size divided by the amount received) to the original price. Key differences for Uniswap V3 For Uniswap V3, the calculations are more complex because liquidity is not evenly distributed across the entire price curve. It is concentrated into specific price ranges. This means: The constant product formula applies only within a given price range, not to the entire pool.Price impact is highly dependent on your trade size relative to the liquidity within the current active price range.
